# ChatGPT in Python (What i like to call the DuranGPT)

ChatGPT in Python (or should I say DuranGPT) is a simple Python command line program that is design to my prefernece and my needs. 

The main purpose of this project is just for me to learn more about the OpenAI ChatGPT API.

## Installation
First, install the OpenAI library:
```bash
pip install openai
```
After that, you can just run the code from ```main.py```

# Future

Will try to add more feature in this program
